# KNIGHT FIGHT
## Developer: Jatin Kumar Mehta
---
* **Night Fight** by Jatin Kumar Mehta is a 2D video game developed in 2 days as a mini-project at ABSS Institute of Technology, Meerut. The game is open-source, allowing anyone to modify or create their own version.
* Note: This version may contain some bugs due to the rushed development process.
---
### DOWNLOAD & PLAY
* To play the game without needing the source files, download the files and go for the file **'Knight_Fight-Jatin_Kumar_Mehta.console.7z'** and extract its contents.
* After extraction, locate and open the executable file **'Knight_Fight-Jatin_Kumar_Mehta.console.exe'** to start the game.
* The executable **'Knight_Fight-Jatin_Kumar_Mehta.console.exe'** relies on another file named **'Knight_Fight-Jatin_Kumar_Mehta.exe'**. While both files run the game, the console version provides additional output. Note: On some systems, **'Knight_Fight-Jatin_Kumar_Mehta.exe' may not work independently**.
* The game runs only on Windows operating systems.
